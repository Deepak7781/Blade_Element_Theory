# Blade Element Theory

## Theory
Blade Element Theory(BET) is a mathematical approach used to analyze the aerodynamic performance of rotating blades, sucha as those found in propellers, wind turbines, helicopter rotors, and aircraft wings.

It breaks down the blade into small segments or "elements" and calculates the forces ( lift and drag ) acting on each segment based on local airflow conditions, blade geometry and angle of attack. By integrating these forces along the length of the blade, BET provides an estimate of the overall thrust, torque, and power generated or absorbed by the system.

BET treats a rotating blade (like a propeller or turbine blade) as a series of independent, infinitesimally small segments or 'elements' along its length. Each element is analyzed as a two dimensional airfoil, subject to local airflow conditions. By calculating the aerodynamic forces ( lift and drag ) on each element and summing ( or integrating ) these contributions across the entire blade, BET determines the total thrust, torque, and power produced or absorbed by the system.

The theory assumes that the flow over each blade element is primarily two-dimensional and unaffected by neighbouring elements, simplifying the complex three-dimensional flow around a rotating blade into a more tractacble problem.

## Parameters involved in BET

### 1. Geometric Parameters

* Number of Blades (B)
    * The total number of blades in the rotor system.
    * Affects the total forces and solidity og the rotor. More blades increase thrust/torque but also drag and structural complexity.

* Blade Radius (R)
    * The total length of the blade from the center of rotation to the tip.
    * Determines the swept area ($\pi R^2$), which dictates how much fluid (air/water) the rotor interacts with, impacting power output.

* Hub Radius (r<sub>hub</sub>)
    * The radius from the center of the rotation to the start of the aerodynamic portion of the b lade (root or hub)
    * Defibnes the non-lifting portion of the rotor near the hub, where airflow is less effective due to structural constraints
    * Typically 5-20 % of R

* Radial Position (r) and Element width (dr)
    * r : Array of radial positions along the blade from, r<sub>hub</sub> to R.
    * dr : Width of each element (dr = (R - r<sub>hub</sub>)/N)

* Chord Length (c)
    * The width of the blade at a given radial position, perpendicular to the span.
    * Influences the lift and drag forces (proportional to c in L = 0.5 $\rho$ V<sup>2</sup>cC<sub>l</sub>)
    * Varies along the blade to optimize performance

* Twist angle ($\theta$)
    * The angle between the chord line of the blade element and the plane of rotation, varying with radius.

* Number of Elements (N)
    * The number of discrete segments the blade is divided into for analysis

### 2.Operating Condition Parameters

* Rotational Speed ($\omega$)
    * The angular velocity of the rotor
    * Determines the tangential velocity (V<sub>t</sub> = $\omega$ r), a key component of the resultant velocity affecting lift and drag

* Free stream velocity ($V_\infty$)
    * Velocity of the undisturbed fluid approaching the rotor
    * The axial component of velocity, driving the flow through the rotor and affecting power extraction or thrust

* Air density ($\rho$)
    * The density of the fluid medium

### 3.Aerodynamic Parameters

* Resultant Velocity ($V_{res}$)
    * The total velocity seen by each blade element, combining axial (V<sub>a</sub>) and tangential ( V<sub>t</sub>) components.
    * Drives lift and drag calculations
    * V<sub>res</sub> = $\sqrt{V_a^2 + V_t^2}$
    * In BET $V_a = V_\infty , V_t = \omega r$

* Inflow Angle ($\phi$)
    * The angle between the resultant velocity and the plane of rotation.
    * $\phi = tan^{-1}\frac{V_a}{V_t}$

* Angle of Attack($\alpha$)
    * The angle between the chord line and the resultant velocity vector
    * Determines $C_l and C_d$ from airfoil data, which are crucial for calculations

* Lift Coefficient ($C_l$)
    * A dimensionless factor representing the lift generated by an airfoil at a given $\alpha$

* Drag Coefficient ($C_d$)
    * A dimensionless factor representing drag at a given $\alpha$

### 4.Output Parameters

* Thrust(T)
    * The axial force produced (propeller) or extracted (turbine)

* Torque(Q)
    * The rotational force around the rotor axis
    * Drives power calculation

* Power(P)
    * The ratio of extracted power to available power in the wind
    * Measures turbine efficiency
